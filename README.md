Focusing on Single Responsibility Principle, web pack, plugins, general review.  

Want to take my time to keep my code modular, and logical with keeping DOM seperated from app logic - following S.R.P

The design I want to go for a modern minimalistic look that most websites seem to adhere to nowadays. 
Something of the looks of this:
https://culturedcode.com/things/features/

Libraries: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns
https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns

To-do object properties: title, details(optional), duedate(optional), important toggle, checklist toggle

Want to add an extra feature for habit tracker,
where for everyday you can add if you did 
the habit. (E.g - exercise, studying, reading).
